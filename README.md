# Hi, I'm Askari! 👋

I'm a Software Engineer who thrives on turning ideas into real-world solutions. I care deeply about **building things that matter**—products that are well-crafted, user-centric, and genuinely useful.

I’m not tied to any single stack. I want to **code, design, scale, fine-tune, deploy, and ship** impactful software—whatever the tools. Whether it's crafting clean UI, optimizing performance, or solving architectural puzzles, I'm here for all of it.
